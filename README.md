# Sovereign Voice Protocol (SVP)
### *Independent Investigative Intelligence*

This repository houses the source code for the **Sovereign Voice Protocol (SVP)**—a custom-built infrastructure designed for unowned investigative journalism. In an era of centralized policy and "boxed-in" creative expression, the SVP provides a direct, transparent frequency for high-level awareness.

## The Philosophy
* **Unowned Investigation**: I do not follow corporate policy; I follow the flow of energy and structural truth. 
* **The Engine**: This system is built from the ground up to render raw data into clear, actionable transmissions.
* **Transparency**: By revealing the source, I validate the integrity of the observation.

## Technical Infrastructure
* **Engine (`svp.js`)**: A custom logic layer for processing complex transmissions and managing data archives without third-party interference.
* **Aesthetic (`svp.css`)**: A visual framework designed to highlight patterns and "pulse" with the rhythm of the investigation.
* **Portal (`index.html`)**: The sovereign interface for real-time creation and structural analysis.

## The Objective
I apply this protocol to environments and entities that require a deeper level of awareness—whether it is the structural integrity of a heritage building, the "Masonry of Control," or the psychological patterns of the performance industry. My work is a service provided to those who value the "Engine" as much as the "Performance."
